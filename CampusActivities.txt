What do you find exciting to do on campus that you couldn't do at home?
I honestly love being able to eat out with friends almost every night (pre-covid), even cooking for friends is just something that I'm not able to do at home.

How often do you take part in it?
I do it as often as I can. Sadly because of COVID, last year I was barely able to do it as most people weren't even on campus. But last semester I did it a decent bit with small groups of like 3-4 people to be COVID safe.
