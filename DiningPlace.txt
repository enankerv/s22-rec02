What is your favorite / least favorite place for food on campus?
My favorite place for food probably has to be the exchange, the quality is always consistently good and it doesnt break the bank. My least favorite place on campus has to be the tepper sandwich shop, I feel like every time I go into the shop it is a coinflip on wether or not the food will be decent that day or bad. Because of that inconsistency I've just grown to dislike it.

What do you like / dislike about it?
