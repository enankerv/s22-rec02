What is your favorite / least favorite place for food on campus?
My favorite place for food probably has to be the exchange, the quality is always consistently good and it doesnt break the bank. My least favorite place on campus has to be the tepper sandwich shop, I feel like every time I go into the shop it is a coinflip on wether or not the food will be decent that day or bad. Because of that inconsistency I've just grown to dislike it.

What do you like / dislike about it?
Oh I guess I explained this a bit too in detail in my intial message. So I'll elaborate more. I love the exchange becasue of its consistency, but also for the friendly faces. One of the servers, Dave, is honestly a shining star of my day. He always asks me how my day is going and honestly is just a great guy. In contrast, I dislike the tepper sandwich shop (I don't even know its proper name) because the food is of inconsistent quality, and the service is very much you order your food, then they give it to you. Nothing too special about it.
